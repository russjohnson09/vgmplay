With just the SN76489 playing for Greeen Hill Zone
you can hear what the sn was mainly focused on
which was sound effects, noise, and precussion.



SN76489 just playing for the SF prologue you
can hear a lot more of the main melody especially
at the first half.

The second half it mostly produces noise.
