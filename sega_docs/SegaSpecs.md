Does more than I thought in terms of the actual music.

The main melody can still be heard without the YM2612.

Sonic The Hedgehog rings alternate left and right. The music of green hill zone you can definitely hear
the stereo sound as well.

I've heard that it is psuedo-stereo that needs to alternate between left and right. For me, I don't
think I can hear the difference between that and true stereo.
